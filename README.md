## Directories

* The Jupyter Notebook demonstrations are in the folder `./demo`
* The folders `./experiment-i`  are the example folders that contain the executable scripts for the simulations in the paper
* The R scripts produce LASSO, SCAD and Fast-BSS results and the U2G results are produced by 
`bash run.sh`
